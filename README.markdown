#Runner's Tracker

This project will be a running log for people wishing to keep track of the miles they run/walk.  It could also potentially be used for other sports.  I'm in the early stages of building this, but hope to have a usable version online in about 4 weeks.

**Features**
- Track daily mileage
- Track mileage on a pair of shoes
- Upload existing running logs from other services through csv files
- View reports of mileage based on custom date ranges and predefined ranges
- Provide a website optimized for mobile devices (_maybe_ an iOS app)

##Technology

This will be a web application using the .NET platform.  Specifically, I am using ASP.NET MVC 4 and Entity Framework 5.  For the front end, I am using Zurb Foundation CSS 4.0.

##Project Tracking

I am using Trello for this project and will eventually get the board available for public viewing.
